This project is a React-based web application that generates and displays AI-powered Anki-style flashcards. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create customized flashcards based on user prompts.


## Features

- **Generate AI-powered flashcards using GPT-4**
- **Interactive flashcard interface with flip animation**
- **Navigation between multiple flashcards**
- **Customizable prompts for flashcard generation**

## How It Works

1. **Prompt Input:** Enter a prompt describing the topic or subject for which they want flashcards generated.

2. **AI Generation:** The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate a set of 10 flashcards based on the user's prompt. Each flashcard consists of a front and a back.

3. **Flashcard Display:** The generated flashcards are displayed in an interactive interface where users can:
   - **Flip cards** to reveal the answer.
   - **Navigate** between cards using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
   - **See their progress** (current card number / total cards).
